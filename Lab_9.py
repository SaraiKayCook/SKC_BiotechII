#The most interesting and useful part of basic Python to me is the ability to
#edit lists even after they are made. This can be demonstrated in the code
#below.

#Make a list of colors
colors = ["purple", "pink", "orange"]

#Print the second item on the list
print(colors[1])

#Add a color
colors.append("green")

#Remove a color
colors.remove("pink")

#Print the new list
print(colors)
